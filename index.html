                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <h4>Past Work</h4>
                <p>How I got here will be covered in the next block but for the last 3 years I been hopping between several jobs with a focus on food service. The most underlying point of all of it is that for the last four summers I was working as a summer camp councler either on the beach or in the kitehen.</p>
                <h4>Education</h4>
                <p>There are really two part that I feel are most revelent to the work we are doing here. High school, thats when I first got a taste of programing. I took AP computer science in my junior year and decided that it was something that I was intrested in. I went to college for computer science at Seattle U but dropped out after my freshmen year. My problem wasn't the coding, that went fine it was most everything else around it that dragged me down. So I'm here now to give it another shot in a program that is more focused and fast paced</p>
